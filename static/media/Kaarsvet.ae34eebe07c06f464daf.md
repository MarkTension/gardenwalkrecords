### Kaarsvet

Kaarsvet is made in the pandemic of 2020-202? in recording studio downtime. Kaarsvet started with a test recording of a newly acquired distortion guitar pedal, with a guitar tuned all the way down to C - because ROCK. The piece in question (‘Como Perry II’) turned out a bit more emo than ROCK. It took me back to that point in the past in which I was just making like crazy. No limitations other than my imagination.

One day of recording followed by one day of mixing. The rest of the album followed relatively quick. Challenges were made: opposed to taking loads of time producing pieces of music for others, the pieces needed to be written, recorded and mixed within two days each - that was the main challenge.

Other challenges included that ‘M104’ couldn’t contain any guitar in the proces (I cheated), ‘Bauxiet’ could only contain drums while being a ‘pop-song’ and ‘Nocturne In D Mineur’ started out as a ‘classical’ piece existing mainly out of monophonic synthesizer layers voiced as orchestral instruments - later to be reamped in a giant indoor skatepark to approach the acoustics of a concert hall with special thanks to Tijmen van Wageningen at the Womb Studio, The Hague. ‘Voor Martin’ was made without a computer other than the digitalization in order to get it onto my computer.

Mark Tensen of Garden Walk records also played a big part in making this record. For the first time I let somebody in while still making - usually I keep things for myself but Mark turned out so enthusiastically that it motivated me loads.

What didn’t change opposed to earlier work (‘M4’ and ‘String Palooza’ will be on streaming services too in a bit!) is that the equipment used played a major part in the composing, the arranging and production aspects of the music. I like to collect limiting tools and instruments that inspire. Big roles for the Korg MS20 synthesizer, Revox A77 tape recorder, Crucianelli semi-acoustic guitar, classical vinyl (I found these really cool demonstration ‘flexidisc’ records that introduced all instruments separately with samples!) and Tascam Porta 07 cassettedeck on Kaarsvet.
