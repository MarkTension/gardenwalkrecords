### Hi buddy’s & budettes!

My name is Matthieu and I am the singer and guitarist of the Amsterdam folk-band Lion’s Den. Most of my songs are about strange dreams, lost loves or flowing feelings. For the new EP ‘In Tune’, coming out on the 25th of February, I recorded the songs with the amazing band: Martin van der Heide (keys), Pelle Bast (bass) and Thijs Janssen (sax/guitar). Dan Huijser produced and recorded the songs in his studio Funky Kerst (you can also hear him play some live drum occasionally).

Unlike our last EP I wanted to record more as a live band then before and wanted to sound more like a band than a singer/songwriter who plays with a band. With the production by Dan and wizard Martin I am really happy with the result. To give you something to listen to in the meantime: Here’s a link to our single Love/Remain and these are my favorite albums of 2021:

1. Bleachers – Take the Sadness out of Saturday Night
2. Erika de Casier – Sensational
3. Bonny Light Horseman – Bonny Light Horseman
4. Big Red Machine – How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last?
5. Fleet Foxes - Shore
