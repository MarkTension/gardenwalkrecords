### Hello World

Garden walk records is an experimental label, or more a platform than a label at this moment.

With this platform we're bringing together like-minded artists. Our motives and goals might be different; Some are pushing towards experimentation, while others are exploring the edges of pop music.

Yet, we dig the same music and share a deep urge to create meaningful work in sound. We're united to help another find new interesting ways to experiment, and inspire another through collaboration.

Also we're not solely focussed on hosting musicians, but are actively looking to combine music with interesting visuals.

That's it for now, but stay updated on what we do by following this website.
