### Manifesto - The Chosen Album:

Good Music, headphones, and a 40 minute oasis of time can be a damn fine experience. How often does that really happen though? ThE GRRrrRiiind is a real thing‚Ä¶. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to claim back some time and space to give new music a place? There are too many good albums out there to be left undiscovered.

Over a morning burrito and black coffee, we tried to come up with ways to make exploring good music part of our week. We thought of this: 

What if we give you an incentive for fully immersing yourself in an album by sending you a weekly newsletter with a chosen album, carefully selected and accompanied by a motivation on why this album deserves some focussed listening. To stay motivated, we hope to do this with a bunch of people, united under the weekly newsletter and a Discord-group where thoughts on the album can be shared.

### How it works specifically:
- There‚Äôs a weekly-listenings-email and discord group
- In the discord, propose an album that you wanna listen to
- Each week, you‚Äôll be sent the chosen album via email
- Block time in your agenda for the listening session.
- Listen to the album (doing little else)
- (Optionally) discuss on discord anything you want to share about it
- Each week‚Äôs experiences from discord get scanned by Camiel and me, so we will select a few comments that will appear as an afterthought with each chosen album email.
- Repeat üîÅ
