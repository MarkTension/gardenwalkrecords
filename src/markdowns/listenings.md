### Manifesto - The Chosen Album:

Good Music, headphones, and a 40 minute oasis of time can be a damn fine experience. How often does that really happen though? ThE GRRrrRiiind is a real thing‚Ä¶. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to claim back some time and space to give new music a place? There are too many good albums out there to be left undiscovered.

Over a morning burrito and black coffee, Camiel and I tried to come up with ways to make exploring good music part of our week. We knew that it had to be something rhythmic, and done with others. Here‚Äôs what we came up with
We‚Äôd like to do listening sessions, just once a week, to listen uninterruptedly to one new album. We can do it all by ourselves, Y‚Äôall just get an extremely short weekly newsletter with the chosen album. Throughout the week, we can all discuss the album or propose new ones.. 

### How it works specifically:
- There‚Äôs a weekly-listenings-email and discord group
- In the discord, propose an album that you wanna listen to
- Each week, you‚Äôll be sent the chosen album via email
- Block time in your agenda for the listening session.
- Listen to the album (doing little else)
- (Optionally) discuss on discord anything you want to share about it
- Each week‚Äôs experiences from discord get scanned by Camiel and me, so we will select a few comments that will appear as an afterthought with each chosen album email.
- Repeat üîÅ
